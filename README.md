# Global-COVID-19-Data-Analysis-Visualization
This project explores global COVID-19 trends using real-world data. It analyzes total cases, deaths, vaccinations, and country-wise comparisons to uncover patterns and insights throughout the pandemic. The final report includes interactive visualizations, plots, and a narrative summary of findings.

Objectives

- Import and clean COVID-19 global data
- Analyze trends in cases, deaths, and vaccinations over time
- Compare metrics across countries (e.g., Kenya, USA, India)
- Visualize trends using line charts, bar plots, and choropleth maps
- Communicate insights through visualizations and markdown narratives

- Tools & Libraries Used

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas – for data manipulation
- Matplotlib & Seaborn – for visualizations
- Plotly Express – for interactive choropleth maps
- NumPy – for numeric operations

Insights & Reflections
The U.S. and India experienced the highest case surges globally, while Kenya maintained lower case levels.

Death rates were influenced not just by cases, but by healthcare systems and vaccine rollouts.

Countries with early access to vaccines (like the U.S.) achieved higher vaccination coverage faster.

Visualizations made it easier to spot waves of infection and vaccine impact.

The choropleth maps provided a global snapshot of disparities in case counts and vaccine coverage.
